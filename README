Nexus – Decentralized P2P Engine
================================

Nexus is a lightweight peer-to-peer (P2P) engine built on **GNUnet**. It provides a common networking layer for GNU projects, enabling:

- Decentralized file and code sharing  
- Distributed computation and task execution  
- Synchronization of simulation data and AI models  

All nodes communicate securely using end-to-end encryption. Nexus is modular: a **core daemon** manages the network, while **client libraries** allow projects like Holos, Chrono, and Gdev to connect easily.
